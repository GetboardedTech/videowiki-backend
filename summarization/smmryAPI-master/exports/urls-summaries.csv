""I cannot even begin to image the problems a flamethrower would cause firefighters and police officers alike."" That hasn't stopped the 20,000 preorders for the flamethrower to be exhausted in days, even at the $500 asking price for what appears to be a modified Airsoft gun with a propane torch attachment.",7,Musk plans Boring Co. flamethrower rebranding to avoid customs scrutiny,29%,3,"['flamethrower', 'Musk', 'actually']"
