# SMMRY API Wrapper for Python

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to sign up for the app and [register for a partner account](http://smmry.com/partner). In "free mode", you can submit up to 100 requests in 24 hours. Once you obtain your API key, export it as an environment variable in your shell. (Aternatively, assign your key to a new variable once you're in python.)

**In shell:**

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

`$ export SMMRY_API_KEY='YOUR API KEY HERE'`

**In Python:**


```python
import os

SMMRY_API_KEY = os.environ.get('SMMRY_API_KEY')
```

**Altnernatively...**


```python
SMMRY_API_KEY = 'YOUR API KEY HERE'
```

Once your have your key, import the module and create an instance of the Smmry object.


```python
from smmryapi import SmmryAPI

smmry = SmmryAPI(SMMRY_API_KEY)
```

## Requesting Summaries

To request the summary for an article pass an article's URL to the `.summarize()` method. A URL is the only required parameter, and by default, the method will return a seven-sentence summary. I'll use this [this *BBC* article](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43298897) as an example with `sm_length=3` to request a three-sentence summary. 

(The maximum sentences retrieved is 40.) 


```python
url = 'http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43298897'

s = smmry.summarize(url,sm_length=3)
```

The method returns a `Summary` object with a varying set of attributes (depending on your parameters).

### Accessing summaries...

Article summaries will be store in the `sm_api_content` attribute.


```python
s.sm_api_content
```




    'Too many Lego bricks is a problem many parents will sympathise with, but now the toy firm itself has admitted it has made too many. 915,103,765 - the number of ways to combine six two-by-four Lego bricks of the same colour. 3,700 - the number of different types of Lego bricks. In September, Lego said its half-year results had suffered because it had stretched itself too thin by diversifying into products that were not toys, such as the Lego movies. Lego chairman Jorgen Knudstorp said at the time that adding complexity to the company had made it harder for the toymaker to grow further.'



### Accessing keywords...

If you pass an integet to `sm_keyword_count` it will return the requested number of keywords for that article. Note that the `sm_api_keyword_array` will only be available if a value for `sm_keyword_count` is selected.


```python
s = smmry.summarize(url,sm_length=3,sm_keyword_count=12)

s.sm_api_keyword_array
```

### Other attributes...

To check out other attributes view the [official documentation](https://smmry.com/api) or or run `s.__dict__.keys()`.


```python
s = smmry.summarize(url,sm_length=5,sm_keyword_count=3)
    
attributes = (
    s.sm_domain,               # The domain name of the URL
    s.sm_api_title,            # The article's titled 
    s.sm_url,                  # URL of the article 
    s.sm_api_content_reduced,  # Percent by which reduced
    s.sm_length,               # Number of sentences 
    s.sm_requests_remaining,   # Number of queries left
    s.sm_api_keyword_array     # Keywords
)

result = """

SMMRY reduced %s article "%s" from url
[%s] by %s to %s sentences.

You have %s requests remaining today.

Top keywords are: %s.'
"""

print(result % attributes)
```
